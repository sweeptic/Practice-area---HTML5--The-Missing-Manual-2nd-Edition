                <h1>A One Page FAQ</h1>
                <h2>I've heard that JavaScript is the long-lost fountain of youth. Is this true?</h2>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Why, yes it is! Studies prove that learning JavaScript freshens the mind and extends life span by
                        several hundred years. (Note: some scientists disagree with these claims.)</p>
                </div>
                <h2>Can JavaScript really solve all of my problems?</h2>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Why, yes it can! It's the most versatile programming language ever created and is trained to
                        provide financial management advice, life-saving CPR, and even to take care of household pets.
                    </p>

                <h2>Is there nothing JavaScript <em>can&#8217;t</em> do?</h2>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Why, no there isn&#8217;t! It&#8217;s even able to write its own public relations-oriented
                        Frequently Asked Questions pages. Now that&#8217;s one smart programming language!</p>
